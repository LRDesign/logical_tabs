== logical_tabs

NOTE:  This is the version for Rails 2, which is configured as a plugin and not a gem.  Please
see the master branch for the Rails 3 gem.

Logical Tabs is a Rails plugin for generating a tabbed panel interface.  It has a couple of advantages over existing solutions (like the tabs item in JQuery UI, or the old Rails plugin railstabbedpanel):
  • Tabs are persistent across page loads.   Reload a page and the tab you had selected is still selected.

  • Rails helper to write the HTML for you and keep the IDs of all the elements involved straight.   Less HTML for you to write and manage.

  • If you create multiple tabbed panels on one page, the helper will automatically increment a suffix on the element's ID to keep them distinct.

It is currently in development (v0.6) and is not yet quite production-ready.   Plans for LT include:

  • Unobtrusive javascript on simple markup.
  • Compatible with both Prototype and jQuery.
  • HTML helpers compatible with both ERB and HAML, resistant to future changes in ActionView::Base and HAML.
  • Session memory of selected tab via an ajax controller - visit a page again and the last-selected tab will still be selected.
  • Near-complete or complete drop-in replacement for railstabbedpanel for easy migration.
  • jQuery option written as a proper jQuery UI plugin so it can be skinned with themeroller.

Note: this is a bit of a weekend hack.  In particular, it was written primarily for Prototype, and the jQuery version of the javasscript is a quick hack of the prototype code to make it work in jQuery.  It does work, but is not a proper jQuery plugin and doesn't talk to jQueryUI at all.   I do plan to clean this up for future releases, but am happy to accept contributions from anyone else who is interested.

== Installing

Install the plugin:
  script/plugin install https://LRDesign@github.com/LRDesign/logical_tabs.git -r rails2_plugin

Basic stylesheets for the tabs are available in either CSS or SASS.   Copy the one you prefer into your public/stylesheets directory:
  cp vendor/plugins/logical_tabs/stylesheets/tabbed_panel.css public/stylesheets/
    - OR -
  cp vendor/plugins/logical_tabs/stylesheets/sass/tabbed_panel.sass public/stylesheets/sass/

Copy the appropriate javascript file into your javascripts/ directory.  JS files are provided that
are compatible with both Prototype and jQuery.

  cp vendor/plugins/logical_tabs/javascripts/logical_tabs_prototype.js public/javascripts
    - OR -
  cp vendor/plugins/logical_tabs/javascripts/logical_tabs_prototype.js public/javascripts


And include the js in your application layout:
 For Prototype: <%= javascript_include_tag 'logical_tabs_prototype.js' %>
 For jQuery: <%= javascript_include_tag 'logical_tabs_prototype.js' %>

Note that both of the above javascripts include dependencies; logical_tabs_prototype.js includes a copy of Lalit Patel's CookieJar (http://www.lalit.org/lab/jsoncookies ) and logical_tabs_jquery.js includes a copy of Jon Combe's Jookie.   If you already have one of those libraries installed in your application, you'll want to strip the duplicate out of this plugin's js file.

== Example Usage

Create new tabbed panels by calling the 'create_tabbed_panel' helper and feeding blocks of content to the 'add_tab' method:

<% create_tabbed_panel do |tabbed_panel| %>
  <% tabbed_panel.add_tab("Tab One") do %>
    Content for Tab One
  <% end %>
  <% tabbed_panel.add_tab("Tab Two") do %>
    Content for Tab Two
  <% end %>
  <% tabbed_panel.add_tab("Tab Three") do %>
    <p>Content for Tab Three</p>
  <% end %>
<% end %>

You can override the ID or text used for a tab:
  <% tabbed_panel.add_tab("Tab Four", :base_id => 'my_tab', :text => "Tab Text") do %>
    Content for Tab four.
  <% end %>

You can also specify pane content rather than pass a block:
<% tabbed_panel.add_tab("Tab Four", :content => "Content for tab four") %>

In each case, the helper will generate a DIV that contains a UL of the tabs (each tab in an LI) and a set of DIVs containing each of the content panes.
