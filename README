logical_tabs
===========

Logical Tabs is a Rails plugin for generating a tabbed panel interface.  

It is currently in development.   Plans for LT include:
  • Unobtrusive javascript on simple markup.
  • Compatible with both Pototype and jQuery.
  • Compatible with both ERB and HAML, resistant to future changes in ActionView::Base and HAML.
  • Session memory of selected tab via an ajax controller - visit a page again and the last-selected tab will still be selected.   
  • Near-complete or complete drop-in replacement for railstabbedpanel for easy migration.
