== LogicalTabs

LogicalTabs is a Rails gem for generating a tabbed panel interface.  It has a couple of advantages over existing solutions (like the tabs item in JQuery UI, or the old Rails plugin railstabbedpanel):
• Tabs are persistent across page loads.   Reload a page and the tab you had selected is still selected.
• Rails helper to write the HTML for you and keep the IDs of all the elements involved straight.   Less HTML for you to write and manage.
• If you create multiple tabbed panels on one page, the helper will automatically increment a suffix on the element's ID to keep them distinct.
• Unobtrusive javascript on simple markup.
• Compatible with both Prototype and jQuery.
• HTML helpers compatible with both ERB and HAML, resistant to future changes in ActionView::Base and HAML.

Note: jQuery compatibility is a bit of a weekend hack.  In particular, it was written primarily for Prototype, and the jQuery version of the javasscript is a quick hack of the prototype code to make it work in jQuery.  It does work, but is not a proper jQuery plugin and doesn't talk to jQueryUI at all.   I do plan to clean this up for future releases, but am happy to accept contributions from anyone else who is interested.

In an upcoming version we will release it with a third Javascript that uses NinjaScript syntax.   For
more information on NinjaScript, see https://github.com/LRDesign/NinjaScript.

== Compatibility

logical_tabs >= 0.8.0 is built for Rails 3.0.x.   Versions below 0.8 were a plugin (not a gem) for Rails 2.x.  If you want to use LogicalTabs with Rails 2.x, see the "rails2_plugin" branch of this project on github:
  https://github.com/LRDesign/logical_tabs/tree/rails2_plugin

== Installing

Add to your Gemfile:
  gem 'logical_tabs'

Installer script coming shortly.  The documentation below this line does not work yet.

Install the basic stylesheets and javascripts:
  rails generate logical_tabs install [ --sass ] [ --jquery ]

The above command installs CSS stylesheet into public/stylesheets and a prototype version of the
javascript into public/javascripts.   Pass '--sass' to  instead copy a SASS version to public/stylesheets/sass.   Pass '--jquery' to copy the jquery javascript instead of the prototype.

And include the js in your application layout:
 For Prototype: <%= javascript_include_tag 'logical_tabs_prototype.js' %>
 For jQuery: <%= javascript_include_tag 'logical_tabs_prototype.js' %>

Note that both of the above javascripts include dependencies; logical_tabs_prototype.js includes a copy of Lalit Patel's CookieJar (http://www.lalit.org/lab/jsoncookies ) and logical_tabs_jquery.js includes a copy of Jon Combe's Jookie.   If you already have one of those libraries installed in your application, you'll want to strip the duplicate out of this plugin's js file.

== Example Usage

Create new tabbed panels by calling the 'create_tabbed_panel' helper and feeding blocks of content to the 'add_tab' method:

  <% create_tabbed_panel do |tabbed_panel| %>
    <% tabbed_panel.add_tab("Tab One") do %>
      Content for Tab One
    <% end %>
    <% tabbed_panel.add_tab("Tab Two") do %>
      Content for Tab Two
    <% end %>
    <% tabbed_panel.add_tab("Tab Three") do %>
      <p>Content for Tab Three</p>
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

You can override the ID or text used for a tab:
  <% tabbed_panel.add_tab("Tab Four", :base_id => 'my_tab', :text => "Tab Text") do %>
    Content for Tab four.
  <% end %>

You can also specify pane content rather than pass a block:
  <% tabbed_panel.add_tab("Tab Four", :content => "Content for tab four") %>

In each case, the helper will generate a DIV that contains a UL of the tabs (each tab in an LI) and a set of DIVs containing each of the content panes.
